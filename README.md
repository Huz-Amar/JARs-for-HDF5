# JARs-for-HDF5
Contains JARs needed to get HDF5 working on an IDE

### Reasoning
HDF5 has its own download page where you can get the zip file [here](https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdf5/), but I, along with many other users I believe, could not get this working. After some research, I got the idea to directly import the JARs for HDF5 into an IDE and use the library that way. The reason for this Github page is not just to give instructions to users looking to use HDF5 but to also provide a place to grab the JARs (and dll files), since links on the internet can quickly become dead.

### JARs
There are two available HDF5 JARs in this project, for versions 2.6.1 and version 3.3.2
Note that with version 3.3.2, it is necessary to also use the slf4j library, found in its respective folder.
